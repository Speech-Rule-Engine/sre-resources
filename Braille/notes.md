Contour integral:

MC: I found guidance on this in the new Nemeth UEB manual. Section 10.11 has curved arrows indicating clockwise or counterclockwise. That symbol can then be superposed on the integral following the procedures in 13.5.



Missing:

Prime: eg. x'^2
Contracted space: x^{1,2}


nested mathrm etc. for fonts.

Check with Michael: 

In puncutation-ellipsis-cell: We could have the correct ellipsis with
      "[n] text()",
